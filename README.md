### Issue the following commands once you have the container up and running:
  ```

    cd ~/code/cesium-quickstart
    npm install

  ```

    The process will be finished shortly._

  ```

    npm start

  ```

  then navigate to the top part of your in browser editor and click Preview -> 8080

## Congratulations!
